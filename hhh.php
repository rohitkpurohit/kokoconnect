<p>Hello innovativecreation, </p>
<p>I see you may have signed up for   more than one Elance account which is a violation of Elance policy. This   policy is just one way to help ensure clients and freelancers know   exactly who they are working with and it encourages trust in the   marketplace.</p>
<p>In my review, your account appears to be linked with these accounts: </p>
<p>innovativecreation<br>
  softplanetindia</p>
<p>Please review our Terms and Conditions using the following link: <br>

<p>I   have put your account on hold until the team and I are able to resolve   this issue.  You still have access to your Workroom and tools to   complete your existing jobs, but you will not be able to submit new   bids.  Also, any payments made between the accounts named above may be   refunded to the original source. </p>
<p>I would like to help you to   resolve this issue quickly. Please reply to this email with any   information that would explain the connection between these accounts.    Based on your reply, I may ask for additional information or actions,   but your first response will help me get started.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your cooperation and understanding.</p>
<p>Regards, <br>
  Taylor<br>
  Elance Risk Management Team</p>
